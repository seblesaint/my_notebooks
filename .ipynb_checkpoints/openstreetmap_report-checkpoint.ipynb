    "The strategy from udacity course \"Case Study: OpenStreetMap Data [SQL]\" has been applied and adapted.\n",

    "\n",
    "A good and robust way of improving the content of the database would be to develop a cleaning robot that fixes all `adress` tags by querying the proper street name to the french official website <a href=\"https://www.cadastre.gouv.fr/scpc/rechercherPlan.do\" target=\"_blank\">cadastre</a> which references all the streets in France. This could be achieved by applying the tips and tricks presented during the lesson 3 \"Data in More Complex Formats\" which teaches how to scrap data from any http server, by identifying the part of the http content in charge of our query  and extracting the relevant information with python module BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "***\n",
    "Another idea would be to encourage contributors, rather than simply declaring an `adress` tag, with sometimes wrong street names, to reference an existing street way through a `relation` OSM feature.\n",
    "***\n",
    "Last idea would be to develop an engine that for every node and way tag that uses `adress:street` and/or `adress:housenumber` entries:\n",
    "- get its node or way parent\n",
    "- get its exact location (node) or average location (way)\n",
    "- retrieves the closest and available street way\n",
    "- adds the needed relation features if not existing\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas were not implemented in this project, however we can foresee the following benefits and difficulties:\n",
    "- Benefits:\n",
    "    - Street names would be defined once, thus names would be unique! This property is the basis of any robust database\n",
    "    - Fully exploit the relational property of OSM schema would avoid redundancies\n",
    "- Possible issues:\n",
    "    - Scraping the official \"cadastre\" website is maybe not as simple as scraping the TranStats aircraft traffic website!\n",
    "    - Automating the construction of missing features such as housenumber nodes or ways relation may be tricky...\n",

    "\n",
    "This OSM project was a great opportunity to:\n",
    "- discover OSM as opensource alternative for my maps\n",
    "- grasp the limits of opensource contributions\n",
    "- think of how theses contributions could be improved\n",
    "- think of memory management while feeding the SQL database with big data\n",
    "- practice SQL queries and database management\n",
    "- learn `yield` python function and custom generators construction\n",
    "- practice regular expressions for cleaning with `re.sub` function\n",
    "- make progress on Markdown layout"
