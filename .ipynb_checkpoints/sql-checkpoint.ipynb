    "\n",
    "Second, we’re using a left join instead of a plain join.\n",
    "\n",
    "Um, so what’s a left join?\n",
    "SQL supports a number of variations on the theme of joins. The kind of join that you have seen earlier in this course is called an inner join, and it is the most common kind of join — so common that SQL doesn’t actually make us say \"inner join\" to do one.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the second most common is the left join, and its mirror-image partner, the right join. The words “left” and “right” refer to the tables to the left and right of the join operator. (Above, the left table is products and the right table is sales.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular (inner) join returns only those rows where the two tables have entries matching the join condition. A left join returns all those rows, plus the rows where the left table has an entry but the right table doesn’t. And a right join does the same but for the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Just as “join” is short for “inner join”, so too is “left join” actually short for “left outer join”. But SQL lets us just say “left join”, which is a lot less typing. So we’ll do that.)"
